## 🤔What is SurveyX?

![surveyx_frame](assets/SurveyX.png)

**SurveyX** is an advanced academic survey automation system that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-quality, domain-specific academic papers and surveys. By simply providing a **paper title** and **keywords** for literature retrieval, users can request comprehensive academic papers or surveys tailored to specific topics.

## 🆚 Full Version vs. Offline Open Source Version

The open-source code in this repository only provides offline processing capabilities. If you want to experience the full features, please log in to [our website](https://www.surveyx.cn).

**Missing features in the open-source version:**
1. **Real-time online search:** You can only generate surveys based on your own uploaded `.md` format references. The open-source version lacks access to our paper database, web crawler system, keyword expansion algorithms, and dual-layer semantic filtering for literature acquisition.
2. **Multimodal document parsing:** The generated survey will not include image understanding or illustrations from the references.

To experience the complete version, please visit: [https://surveyx.cn](https://surveyx.cn)

## 🛠️ How to Use the Offline Open Source Version

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (Anaconda recommended)
- All Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- LaTeX environment (for PDF compilation):
- You need to convert all your reference documents to Markdown (`.md`) format and put them together in a single folder before running the pipeline.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install texlive-full
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/SurveyX.git
cd SurveyX
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### LLM Configuration

Edit `src/configs/config.py` to provide your LLM API URL, token, and model information before running the pipeline.

Example:
```python
REMOTE_URL = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
TOKEN = "sk-xxxx..."
DEFAULT_EMBED_ONLINE_MODEL = "BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5"
EMBED_REMOTE_URL = "https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/embeddings"
EMBED_TOKEN = "your embed token here"
```

### Workflow


Each run creates a unique result folder under `outputs/`, named by the task id `outputs/<task_id>` (e.g., `outputs/2025-06-18-0935_keyword/`).

Run the full pipeline:
```bash
python tasks/offline_run.py --title "Your Survey Title" --key_words "keyword1, keyword2, ..." --ref_path "path/to/your/reference/dir"
```

Or run step by step:
```bash
export task_id="your_task_id"
python tasks/workflow/03_gen_outlines.py --task_id $task_id
python tasks/workflow/04_gen_content.py --task_id $task_id
python tasks/workflow/05_post_refine.py --task_id $task_id
python tasks/workflow/06_gen_latex.py --task_id $task_id
```

**Note:** Your local reference documents **must be in Markdown (`.md`) format** and placed in a single directory.

### Output

- All results are saved under `outputs/<task_id>/`
  - `survey.pdf`: Final compiled survey
  - `outlines.json`: Generated outline
  - `latex/`: LaTeX sources
  - `tmp/`: Intermediate files

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Our retrieval engine may not have access to many papers that require commercial licensing. If your research topic requires papers from sources other than arXiv, the quality and comprehensiveness of the generated papers may be affected due to limitations in our retrieval scope.
- We currently only support the generation of English academic survey generation. Support for other languages is not available.
- To ensure fair access for all users, each user is limited to one generation per day, prioritizing diverse user needs.

For questions or issues, please open an issue on the repository.

SurveyX uses advanced language models to assist with the generation of academic papers. However, it is important to note that the generated content is a tool for research assistance. Users should verify the accuracy of the generated papers, as SurveyX cannot guarantee full compliance with academic standards.
